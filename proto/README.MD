# When editting PB messages

*Make sure to read both gen_proto_\* files before using them!*

1. Edit the .proto and .options files
2. Run both gen_proto_* files 
``` bash
./gen_proto_python;./gen_proto_arduino
``` 

Those scripts assume the project is located in the right folders as explained in the main README.MD

If you don't have your git folder in your /home/username/ then you shouldn't use these files.

It also assumes that nanoPB is installed in your /snap folder.
